    "'''Q10- Common measures of central tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by summing all values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values. It represents the \"center\" of the data. The mean is sensitive to outliers; extreme values can significantly affect its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. Unlike the mean, the median is less affected by extreme values and is a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), multiple modes (multimodal), or no mode if all values are unique. The mode is useful for categorical or discrete data and can provide insights into the most common value or category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common measures of variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data but is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It provides a more comprehensive measure of variability but is sensitive to the units of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average distance of data points from the mean and provides a measure of dispersion around the mean. Like variance, it is sensitive to the units of measurement but is often preferred due to being in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures collectively provide insights into the central tendency and variability of a dataset. The choice of measure depends on the nature of the data and the specific characteristics of interest. For example, if the dataset is symmetric and normally distributed, the mean and standard deviation may be appropriate measures. If the dataset is skewed or contains outliers, the median and interquartile range might be more suitable.'''"
